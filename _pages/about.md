Hi, I am Xiaoming Ran, a PhD student at [Department of Marine Technology](https://www.ntnu.edu/imt), Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). Currently, I am working on floating wind turbines and contributing to the [FLOAWER](https://www.floawer-h2020.eu/) European MSCA project.

My background
======
I received both my Bachelor's degree and Master's degree from the Dalian University of Science and Technology (DUT), where I spent seven years studying Ocean engineering. I am interested in fluid mechanics. The thesis for my B.E. and M.E. are all about hydrodynamic analysis using Potential Flow Theory-based methods and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods.

Hobbies

I am passionate about doing sports and studying new things.
* Sports: Hiking, Running, Badminton, Tennis. (Recently, I also do bouldering and skiing.)
